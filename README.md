Scripts to retrieve data sets and some essential metadata from the 
[Europeana Search API](https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis/search).

All included scripts are to be run with bash.

## Usage

Create a `env.sh` file (copy from `env.sh.template`) and insert your Europeana API key.
Such a key can be requested via [Europeana Pro](https://pro.europeana.eu/resources/apis).

Then run `main.sh` or one of the individual scripts to retrieve the data.
